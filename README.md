# atom
shared, synchronous, independent state for javascript apps.

Basically re-implemented the [Redux](http://gaearon.github.io/redux/) API
without ES6 syntax and some of the top-level API exports.

## Concepts

1. You're application state is hidden within the `atom` function. It cannot be
   mutated outside of the atom function.
2. To affect your state, you need to `trigger` an "action".
3. "actions" can be just a string, or an object or any value you want.
4. You define a single "reducer" function that accepts the current state and action and returns a new state.
5. You can register any # of "subscribers" that are called after your reducer returns a new state.

## Example

```javascript
function counter(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'INCREMENT':
    return state + 1;
  case 'DECREMENT':
    return state - 1;
  case 'INCREMENT_ASYNC':
    return function(dispatch) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'});
      }, 1000);
    };
  default:
    return state;
  }
}

var store = atom(counter, 0);

store.subscribe(function() {
  console.log(store.getState())
});

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }); // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT_ASYNC' }); // 2
```

## API

### atom(reducer[, initialState])

Creates your atom `store` that contains your application state. Returns an Object with methods for interacting with your state.

#### reducer(state, action)

A function that accepts `function(state, action)` and returns the potentially modified `state`. You can also return a function with the signature `function(dispatch)` for performing asynchronous tasks before modifying the state. When your async task completes, the passed in `dispatch` function can be called with an "action" that results your reducer returning a new state.

### Store API

#### dispatch(action)

This calls your "reducer" with the current state and the given "action".

#### subscribe(listener)

Add a function to be called anytime after your "reducer" has returned a new state. This is useful for logging changes or syncing to your storage or database.

You can add as many listeners as you would like.

#### getState()

Returns the current state. Useful for calling within a `subscribe`d listener.
